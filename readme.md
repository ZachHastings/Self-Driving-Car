# Self Driving Car

Oct 1 – Oct 7
-	Continue work on lane detection (Zach)
-	Finish getting TensorFlow set up (Dylan)
-	Make a 3D model mount for the camera/IR/Distance sensors (Isaac)

Oct 8 – Oct 14
-	Continue work on lane detection (Zach)
-	Figure out how to power on/off IR lights from button or on the web UI (“night mode”)
-	Get object detection running on Dylan’s desktop
-	Work on sending picture from car to TensorFlow on Dylan’s desktop and returning results
-	Print camera mount

Oct 15 – Oct 21
-	Finish up lane detection? (Zach)
-	Work on using results from TensorFlow
-	If lane detection is finished, work on detecting/calculating distance
-	Get “night mode” working
-	3D print stop sign(s)

Oct 22 – Oct 28
-	Continue working on lane detection demo
-	Work on program to implement logic for stop sign during lane detection demo
-	Work on detecting/calculating distance
-	Print stop light
-	Begin documentation

Oct 29 – Nov 4
-	Having working demonstration for lane detection with stop sign
-	Work on adding logic to lane detection demo for stop light
-	Consider building 3D model for car body
-	Work on documentation/presentation
-	Begin working on extended demonstration to video tape

Nov 5 – Nov 11
-	Get demonstration working for lane detection, stop sign, and stop light
-	If on schedule or ahead of schedule:
o	Add logic for stopping for a car
o	Speed limit integration
o	Detect and avoid pedestrians
o	Some reason to use reverse?
-	Possibly 3D print car body
-	Work on documentation and presentation
-	Work on extended demo

Nov 12 – Nov 18
-	Polish code
-	Film extended demo
-	Finish documentation and presentation

Nov 19 – Dec 3
	Buffer time to finish anything we are behind on
