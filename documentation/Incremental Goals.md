The main idea of this project is to create a self-driving model car, based on a remote control vehicle, that will utilize a neural net for the machine to learn how to react to signals, planned or incidental, on the road.

After getting the hardware setup, we may want to download source code from projects that have already accomplished the rudimentary tasks of driving. Then we can test it out and modify it to accomplish the following incremental tasks:
  
  Goals
  -----
  1. Drive forward, backward, left, right with computer as control.
  2. Stream video that can be accessed by a seperate computer.
  3. Live demonstration of object detection from neural network.
  4. Lane/line detection live demonstration.
  5. Follow lane/line through straight lines and curves.
  6. Detect distance of some objects (cars, stop signs, stop lights).
  7. Stop at stop sign, continue after a short wait.
  8. Stop at red light, continue on green.
  9. Stop for car ahead, continue when safe.
  
  Stretch Goals
  -------------
  - Read speed limit sign, adjust speed accordingly.
  - Turn on headlights, drive with lights off.
  - Turn at intersection (possibly with turn signal).
