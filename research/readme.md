### Ideas

[Calculate distance using monocular vision](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2015/01/19/find-distance-camera-objectmarker-using-python-opencv/)

[Video series writing self driving car in GTAV using python](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQVvvaa0QuDeETZEOy4VdocT7TOjfSA8a)
Useful for some fundamental ideas of self driving cars.

[Example self driving car project](https://zhengludwig.wordpress.com/projects/self-driving-rc-car/)
[Repository](https://github.com/hamuchiwa/AutoRCCar) for code.
