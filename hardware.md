# Potential Hardware

Here is a quick list I put together after we decided we were going with a Pi rather than Arduino. I have done a lot of research into the car and it seems like the best option. If anyone has any thoughts or ideas of any pieces I missed or suggestions for better parts, feel free to let me know or add them. For the most part though, I think this list is pretty complete and will work well for our needs.

[Car](https://www.amazon.com/SunFounder-Raspberry-Graphical-Programming-Electronic/dp/B06XWSVLL8)
Features:
* Compatible with Raspberry Pi 3 B+
* Has swivel mount for camera if we decide to use it
* Includes PWM control board for servos
* Includes motor controller for rear powered wheels
* Appears to have sharp turning radius
* Comes with open source application that we could potentially use code from including:
  * Web streaming application
  * Controlling car from computer
  * Controlling camera swivel mount

[Raspberry Pi 3 B+](https://www.robotshop.com/en/raspberry-pi-3-b-computer-board.html)
Self explanatory. Newest/fastest model. Includes dual band wifi, bluetooth, multiple USB ports, and camera port.

[Batteries](https://www.robotshop.com/en/lg-18650-37v-3500mah-lithium-ion-battery-cell.html)
Batteries specified by the car kit. Need 2 batteries but would prefer more eventually so we could charge and run at the same time.
It should be noted though, that currently, only 2 can be ordered at a time from Robot Shop.

[Battery Charger](https://www.robotshop.com/en/42v-18650-lithium-battery-charger-us-plug.html)
Charges 2 batteries at a time.

[Ultrasonic Range Finder](https://www.robotshop.com/en/hc-sr04-ultra01-ultrasonic-range-finder.html)
A distance sensor that is included in a lot of kits, but not this one. I'm not sure if we will end up using it or not, but it's only $3.50 so we should order in case.

[Camera](https://www.robotshop.com/en/raspberry-pi-camera-module-adjustable-focus-night-vision.html)
Camera module. Uses default Pi Camera sensor/board. However, it includes a lense with focal adjustment, as well as the ability to capture IR. Includes 2 IR LEDs, this would potentially allow us to operate the car at night.
This seemed like a decent module for the price, however I could be conviced to go with a different module if anyone has suggestions.
